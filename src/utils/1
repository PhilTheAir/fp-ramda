designing a
capability to deliver better certainty in the project management of megaprojects. The
following information will be helpful for you as context:
Project Structure
• Mega-projects typically involve multiple phases: design, procurement,
construction, commissioning
• Key stakeholders include: owners/clients, main contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers, regulators
• Projects typically have: master schedules with thousands of activities,
numerous contract packages, complex dependencies, and strict milestone
deadlines
Contract Packages
Contract packages are discrete portions of the overall project scope bundled
together and awarded to specific contractors. For example, a rail project might have
separate contract packages for:
• Civil works (tunnels, bridges, earthworks)
• Track installation
• Electrical systems
• Signalling and communications
• Stations and buildings
Each package has its own contract terms, schedule, budget, and risk profile.
Interface risks between packages are particularly important as delays or issues in
one package can impact others.
Cost Elements
• Labor, materials, equipment, overhead, contingency funds
Available Knowledge and Historical Data
Subject Matter Expert Knowledge
A significant amount of knowledge about construction risks exists in the heads of
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who have decades of experience managing similar
projects. This includes:
• Causal relationships between risk factors and actual risks
• Early warning signs that precede major issues
• Complex interdependencies between project elements
• Context-specific risk interpretations that aren't captured in documentation
• Tacit knowledge about effective mitigation strategies
For this exercise, assume the following historical data could be available:
1. Project Documentation
o Complete contract documents from 15 similar past projects
o Detailed schedules (baseline and actuals) from these projects
2. Risk Registers
o 2,000+ documented risks from past projects
o Categorization of risks (commercial, technical, environmental, etc.)
o Probability and impact assessments for each risk
o Mitigation actions taken and their effectiveness
3. External Data
o Weather records for project locations
o Material price indices
o Labor market statistics
o Building and Construction standards
4. Unstructured Data
o Meeting minutes from project reviews
o Issue logs and action trackers
o Lessons learned documents
